# CircleCI runtime for Apache2

Shows you how to use a simple CircleCI setup with Apache2 for browsertests. It uses CircleCI php-browsers as a base image. But then also shows you how to configure it and get it to work. From the CirleCI container you can just go to http://localhost and use apache from there.

Instead of xdebug it uses phpcov for coverage reports.
